#Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability.
#He wants to know the average interest of all deposits groups split by whether the deposit has expired or not.
#But that's not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985.
#Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
